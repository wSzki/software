PROTOTYPES

Hello! Thanks for your interest in Prototypes.

These are small, experimental sketches that are built as proof-of-concept distributions.

See all of them here: https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/mfprototypes/

I do not provide installers or support for them but I will make an effort to reply to questions on IG or Github Issues.

For the most part, they should function as expected as I've tested them on my own systems.

I hope you enjoy them and can make something cool with these sketches.

To install for OSX:
Move the VST and/or Component files to their respective folders
Macintosh HD/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components
Macintosh HD/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST

to install for Windows:
I built an installer. Simply run it and point it to your plugin directory

Thanks and have fun!

Micah
